        '*Small-molecule cryoprotectants like glycerol, DMSO and trehalose have been extensively studied mechanistically regarding their antifreeze effect. Larger molecules such as PEG and some polyampholytes have also shown potential towards ice growth inhibition. However, cryopreservation research using carbohydrate polymers ‚Äì particularly bio-based polysaccharides ‚Äì has been lacking. Despite their inherent biocompatibility that tackles one of the main issues of cryoprotectant exposure, cytotoxicity, most literature focuses purely on post hoc biological viability rather than mechanistic clarifications towards their function, with regards to ice binding, modulation or inhibition. Polysaccharides produced by psychrophiles (cold-adapted microorganisms) that ensure survival in extreme sub-zero habitats are a prime comparative model towards understanding this structure-function interplay. In this review, we summarize the current literature on polysaccharides used in cryopreservation applications and attempt to discern the structural features that contribute to antifreeze performance, from the point of view of polysaccharide-ice interactions.*')
